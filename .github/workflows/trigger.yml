# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Trigger

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  # Change to pull_request for purposes of final demo
  push:
  #   pull_request:
  #      branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "declaration"
  declaration:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job

      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it

        run: echo "branch=$(echo ${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/})" >> $GITHUB_ENV
