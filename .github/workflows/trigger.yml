# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Trigger

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  # Change to pull_request for purposes of final demo
  push:
  #   pull_request:
  #      branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
